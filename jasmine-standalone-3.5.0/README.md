# Bank tech test

## Requirements

- You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)

- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

## Acceptance criteria

Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012

When she prints her bank statement
Then she would see

date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00


## Plan: 

### Input / Output 

Input | Output 
------|--------
deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012 |
deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012 | 
A withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012 |
|| Output:: 


date       || credit  || debit  || balance
14/01/2012 ||         || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 ||        || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 ||        || 1000.00


### Domain Model: 

Object | Message 
-------|---------
Bank:  |
|      | .constructor 
||          - this.balance = 0 
||          - this.credit = [[]]
||          - this.deposit = [[]]
|      | .desposit  (amount, date = Date.now())
|      | .withdrawal (amount, date = Date.now())
|      | .print()

- reconsidered the this.credit / desposit to be one constructor of:

Object | Message 
-------|---------
Bank:  |
|| constructor
|| - this.recordOfTransaction = {
    1: {date: 10.01.2012, credit: 1000.00, debit: "", balance: 1000 }
    2: {date: 13.01.2012, credit: 2000.00, debit: , balance: 3000 }
    3: {date: 14.01.2012, credit: "", debit: 500.00, balance: 2500.00}
}

## My Approach

- Using an 'console error guided' TDD approach. 

- I began by using the console in the SpecRunner.html to begin. This allows me to consider the MVP guided by user interaction.  

- After I address the console error as the first Jasmine test I need to write. For Example: ``` test_bank = Bank new ``` in the console returned Bank undefined.
